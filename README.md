# shadowgen

Very "raw" program which generates an atlas of shadows useful for top-down tiled games; it's the program that has been used to pre-generate the wall shadows in Waking Violet.

YMMV, it was meant as a one-use tool, the quality of the sources reflects this.

The output will be stored in a `c:\temp` directory, in form of png files; name is hardwired in the code.
